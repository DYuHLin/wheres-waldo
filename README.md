# Where's Waldo (Photo Tagging App)
This was quite the challenging project. I learnt a lot about how to use BaaS with Firebase. For this project I used a firestore database to input the scores when a level is done and to fetch the coordinates of the images. I learnt how to use these click events (getBoundingClientRect()) to get the coordinates which was a challenge for sure but the rest was pretty standard Js. All in all it was a fun project and a good introduction into using firebase.
